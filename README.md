Hi I'm a hybrid lawyer scientist data scientist medical researcher and dive instructor as well as a hobbyist maker. 

I've been learning about different types of architecture regarding deep machine learning coding agents for the for those tasks accumulating and importing data into the proper format to be used in the knowledge base or in the fine tuning of various models. 

I've been in my spare time trying to expand my skill set which includes everything from RF engineering electrical engineering and a bit of codeing and Python,Micropython, Circuit python, C+, Jennifer notebooks, GNU Radio, Java and some HTML. 

I'm just a creative person who has for his entire life enjoyed doing a wide ride of things and it helps keep my mind sharp and has been helpful in my day job which I guess you could say is private international attorney working from Geneva Switzerland for a majority of my career but I've also been an assistant attorney general a deputy County attorney and did a little bit of defense so that I could see both sides. 

I did a lot of very large international business transactions across multiple jurisdictions and the entire variety of practice areas everything from running companies forming companies estates trusts media law aviation law securities law you name it my first piece of international work was buying a birth in the south of France and on that job I even had to learn about marking and carving. I've been need attorney and instructing attorney on multiple arbitrations and multiturisdictional civil cases. 

in this particular type of law which they don't really practice in the United States but is an actual specialty in the law here. hear you're working for the extremely wealthy which means that's what they're paying you for to be available 24 hours a day to find the best people to do any job and learn it yourself as well and be able to package and process the work of multiple people on a team into a single product which allows whatever it is they want to do to be done legally and correctly with no errors. 

That's the job not many people can do it I didn't know that I could until I did my three months trial. And then you're considered intern for the first 12 months where there's an unwritten rule that every new lawyer in Switzerland only gets paid $5,000 a month. after your first year you're on the free market and I think they doubled my salary immediately and by the end of the year it had tripled. 

I even left to go get some litigation experience for a year and got hired back by the same firm immediately upon returning. 

so I've spent most of my career working for Swiss Law firms and for private clients but I've also done some prosecution criminal investigation defense and in the course of working for these clients in Switzerland as my former boss used to say I got to do everyday what most of all students wish they could and never will be able to do.

I've worked in more countries than I haven't and I have worked across the Spectrum of legal specialties without one single bar complaint nor an error. 

in fact we can't afford it here as Swiss professional secrecy is so ironclad and there are so few in roads if any save you absolutely knowing that someone's going to hurt someone else that would be the soul and only reason otherwise the only thing they can do to you even if you're called the witness is fine you 100 francs. 

it's not even considered an infraction in your bar record or in your criminal record whatsoever and you can just refuse to testify under the premise of secret professional. 


I think it's what draws a lot of people to Switzerland because as Elon musk is pointed out patents or just a recipe for others to copy your work and it's not like anybody has the time or the money to really litigate people do but frankly they're wasting their time and money because time is money and litigation is expensive. 

I would always use international chamber of Commerce arbitration clauses in every single contract because they're quick they have expert arbiters in every field and you can either pick one that they choose for you or you can choose your own with your own picking the neutral third and if they don't then the president at the time will pick the neutral third for you but in any way that you structure it it's going to be faster cheaper and you'll get an outcome that's competential binding and you present your award to the country if it's a signatory to the contract and the loser pays. 

how you do business and how you make what you make or what it is you make That's the real thing you're wanting to protect and by patent by using the patent system you're basically handing every other company in the world a recipe for what you're doing and how to do it it's outdated and dysfunctional. 

it's best to keep it to yourself and to do your legal business and a jurisdiction which has more or less absolute secrecy and privacy and to arbitrate in an environment which is confidential which guards your business practices and business secrets. 

however after having done that and topped out in that career higher than anybody that I know personally I have grown a little bored with it even though it I guess it would be pretty exciting to most people it's really not and it's super stressful and it wears on you and I would prefer to do something different change up hybridize to something different my own way. 

I've learned so much working with some of the best business people other counse. with all that knowledge and experience having worked in so many areas both flipping undervalued companies more times than I can count and managing clients portfolios when they were out of contact and something would come up I was a registered financial intermediary with the Swiss bankers association. 

so we have the power to adjust the risk ratio of a portfolio should we not be able to contact our client and should there be something like a supply chain problem natural disaster or anything that could drastically cause or affect market volatility. 

As a standard practice it would be moving out of the market into Swiss francs, precious metals, strategic medals, and a spread of commodities. General you don't make money on those asset classes unless they're serious market volatility however if that's the case you maintain asset value or you actually gain. 

it's a no-brainer here everybody who's wealthy and has money or manages money for those who do do pretty much the same thing that's why they still have their money. 

I think nobody where I'm from or where I grew up could imagine what I did everyday for my work I mean they really couldn't as they teach us to do never do what we did every day here and that was our job that was the job description and they try you out for 3 months as an at will employee and then for the remainder of the year you get paid less than minimum wage but then you're free market. 

if you're good at it and I guess you really can never know if you're good at it unless you do it some people can some people can't I never would have a guessed that I would have been so good at what I did but apparently it meshed with my unique way of thinking and the way that I do things so I was extremely successful in that job title but it's not it wasn't worth it to me at the end of the day. 

You pay a price for everything so it depends on what price you're willing to pay for the work you're doing and the price was just too high for this work. 


so I'm on the free market now I'm either going to do something of my own or I'm available for unique work should anyone look at my repositories and see the kind of stuff I'm interested in.... 

That's all that I have here are repositories that I think are interesting or that I might use in a project or for some reason that I get caught in my attention. 

none of my work is here because some of my work would be considered ITAR and I can't release some of it for legal reasons being a dual US and Swiss national.
