    • 👋 Hi, I’m @Aquahoodjd
    • I'm editing this on a rebuilt Tower I thought i bricked but clearly didn't with Ubuntu Studio-. I will be 3 of 5 in a distributed system. This one is done for the moment.
    • I am someone who has had everything they love taken from me by a bad man who almost killed me 4 times and used psychological warfare, as my former boss tolf my sister and mom along with my general practitioner....they didn't care but the docs did. They knew what that meant here. There they had no idea still don't....fake messages, fake rumors, fake back chatter...you think I’ve not seen every current exploit most older  a zero days (now common). there is a hotel in Sion it's a French chain but they had more access points then they could ever possibly need if they had 20 people in each room and 100 people in their conference rooms.n they had a SW c**swisscom logo on the outside of the building but I looked up their IP provider who had it awful reputation and they had zero security appliances on the client side but they would not dare that you touch the hotel side. perhaps on the hotel side they use Swiss come but for their guests and the people in the conference rooms it was a clear lie. I woke up one morning to find virtual Studio running on the only computer available for clients that was supposed to erase when you logged off I just used a random name and random password and it locked me out I also downloaded in the conference room a version of Apple OS Catalina upgrade but little did I know they had packed it inside of an oracle virtual box and when asked after going through and putting in all of my new credentials I was really tired of late at night they said are you sure you want to quit Earl Oracle and I thought to myself I haven't used to Oracle and I said yeah sure I just wanted to go to sleep and then as soon as I hit yes I thought about it and my drives were empty and they had an account I'd owned since I was in college My Philosophy papers pictures of my children growing up they got everything and I never got it back. I wasn't able to respond his phone emotionally my emotional intelligence had been wiped clean but my IQ and my ability to record events happening to me was still completely functional and I remember every detail. at the same Hotel I was hacked through a wireless connected camera and through the HDMI cable provided by the hotel because you can actually provide access points now through HDMI cables. I saw a Chinese man when I was doing some research for my masters in public health at the local water plant for the hydroelectricity that we produce here and he thought I was strange there maybe he thought I was watching him but I was just there under the cantile authority who gave me permission for access to the water sample results from the different Reservoir locations and frankly the water is extremely clean and someone had actually published a very misleading Journal paper which they willed the water in red and yellow with arsenic and uranium which is very common in granite but the values were so low compared to the who minimum values or maximum values rather that she used the color red and yellow in relation to the content was academic fraud. the devil was so little compared to most water filtered through granite which is one of the best filters in nature of water was so low that it is inconsequential to human health. the water was so clean and the minute mineral value was so healthy that you would be an absolute idiot to buy bottled water especially if it's packaged in plastic. at the same time I was shocked that they had actually had some glasses made saying that their water was better than bottled water and you should not you should drink their tap water and they weren't using them I think because of this journal article and it was nothing more than academic clickbait I rather recent one again that was talking about Wellness and if you read the methodology they only used people who might already have predisposing conditions that would have a negative result and only 900 participants in one place that is completely a poor methodology that can lead clearly to erroneous correlations. 
    it's because of this and other factors including the pandemic then I absolutely lost all faith in public health and in the words of a Columbia Professor named Joanne she said maybe I'll have some work for you when you get tired of trying to roll that Boulder uphill.. she was referring to harm reduction and trying to not only get it as policy in Southeast Asia but also trying to get the Americans to end the war on drugs and end their endemic heroin epidemic which we had in Switzerland even so bad as to have a needle Park in Zurich and it was written to keep up with the drug of the day and they haven't doctors and the new pharmacists have forgotten the Horrors of the epidemic we had here that doesn't exist but we do have the three top cities with the highest cocaine use out of the top five in Europe and methamphetamine is coming. there is no replacement or substitution therapy currently because we haven't kept up with the research we have it innovated in this area even though the law tells us to because the authors of this policy called the four pillars policy here we're well aware of the cyclical nature of substance use that heroin use would fall out of fashion and a new truck would take its place and that has happened and there's a very nasty one coming up because it may at the moment be more expensive but everywhere else in the world it's called Poor Man's cocaine because it is so easy to make you can make it in five steps with items that you can acquire from normal stores granted it's dirty and yes that's very much like the on TV the movie breaking Bad but at least he made stuff with correct precursors not train cleaner, boric acid from the swimming store, tell you reading from the furniture recovery store, oh and of course diphenhydramine which gives you a huge jump sold over the counter still here but in the United States they've pulled it all behind the counter and you have to share ID when you buy it. but of course you can make it a little longer and don't tell me that you won't be able to find the precursors in some of the less rule of law based countries that exist in the European Union and our neighbors. don't tell me some of our neighbors wouldn't like to see us less powerful because it is a scourge of society and you can see it all over southeast Asia where it used to be opium dense and the opiate age it's now the ice age which is what they call it and people lose their teeth the complexions and skin becomes very unhealthy is toxic to every single organ system in your body. 
    when people started talking about the pandemic and when all the world leaders instead of the first version of the pandemic decided to go their own way instead of following The who this is the second version of the same group of viruses the first one was contained in one month it was called SARS 1 and this is SARS 2which got the name covid-19 but officially is SARS 2.
    II have taken epidemiology and emerging and evolving disease at The graduate level and what I saw happen was so obscene and so terrible it was something we could easily used simple contact tracing and quick reaction time to contain but now it has become an epidemic or outbreak to a now endemic part of the various litany of ailments that will be with us for quite some time. it didn't have to be that way but even if it were loud produced the delay in declaring a Public Health crisis of international concern which is declared by each country mind you and that treaty should be rewritten to form regional laboratories with multinational staff and by a mere majority they should be able to declare one because the conflict of interest and declaring such a state has such a negative economic impact on the state that declares it because people shut off all trade and travel with the state as they should and actually people should slow down and the economy would be much better off if we determined the incubation period and we let it burn out and we stopped the movement of people no airplanes. 
    I would ask people if they knew who John snow was and if they didn't I wouldn't talk to them because it was so politically charged and everybody had their own opinion but nobody had any form of training and I had I had actually worked as a research assistant in the department of infectious disease at the university of Malaysia and everybody seem to have their own opinion on reality and it didn't help that the government and their Health crisis communication skills were awful. 
and just in case you want the truth yes they allowed the pharmaceutical companies to experiment on the population using a phase 1 through phase 3 clinical trial without full income informed consent without requiring that the companies release the list of ingredients the pharmaceutical companies having Lobby the government's saying that they need to recoup their investments but on this level I think that the public can pay for those because this is an issue where the public good outweighs the right of these companies to make so much profit on people's potentials illness and death. I've taken the vaccine and I've taken the boosters and do I know it's a long-term effects are I don't but I know that there are long-term effects of covid and that covid has potential for death and I would like to live and I was fully aware of the fact that it was a breach of the Helsinki protocol which is the International Medical associations bioethical guidelines for which every country has its own version but it's all pretty close they're a direct result of the Nuremberg trials human research done by the Nazis on the Jewish Holocaust victims. it sets forth the basic rules that people must follow when they do research on human subjects for medical purposes and one of those absolute necessities is full disclosure and legally informed consent and frankly like most waivers and most acknowledgments of risk Irish people don't have illegal backgrounds or the understanding of that particular area of risk or specialty in the case of RNA vaccines and potentially purposely manipulated viruses from that's who are responsible for a lot of zoranic jumps which are always the worst like Marburg machupo Ebola HIV and many more. there's one that's pretty much now endemic in Southeast Asia and there's four types and they don't cause cross immunity and having them in different orders can potentially make them worse but definitely each time you get a new one you run the risk of it becoming a more severe hemorrhagic because it is a hemorrhagic type of infection caused by mosquitoes. the zika virus which my friend is been published in nature medicine on as they pulled him away from his normal focus which is working on trying to repair optic nerves and spinal column injuries but he found along with his five co-authors they were the five Co first authors of the publication it was his idea to take the nature medicine route and they discovered that it goes immediately to your sex organs and to your brain and can have effects on young children so watch your young children when in these areas and it causes your hippocampus to become irregular the cells are rather irregular as opposed to being very homogenous and correctly arranged at best and in the very worst case it causes severe brain deformation in utero. but when people like my daughter told me she didn't take the vaccine I understand because it was a violation of the Helsinki protocol and I took it because of my age and because of other health risk factors and I needed some surgeries which put me in one of the dirtiest places in the world the hospital. 
I did and  they thought I was nuts but now thrse zero days are mostly all common knowledge. When you don't have a photographic memory they didn't remember what I said. They were only concerned with their lives but I had to make sure my life didn't hurt theirs and my children. They never understood how bad and how in the middle of it I was.....dead center in the middle of the start of cold war 2 and they think whatever...doesn't matter what I say or what others say they can't imagine that they have treated me so badly and have been wrong the whole time. They were manipulated by the bad guys and others seeking personal gain. I have seen every scam and trick known to man. Yet -
I try and remain kind. Hard to do when you have been abandoned and your only supporters are people you can't even disclose their names. I can't "out" the members of the intelligence community who have shown me empathy as they know and John Q Public knows very little about me. I have never made specific public comments except now, as I am recovering and I remember everything and can deal with the memories. That is why they have come back. I always try to show my memory to my family using "verbatim" quotes but they don't even remember what they said. Nobody would ever want this memory, Photographic or almost video graphic memories sucks.
 👀 I’m interested in learning. I have an insatiable level of curiosity. I'm someone who was a "big deal" but didn't even know it until I got almost smashed into the ground 2m deep (6 feet deep). I'm really kind and nice. You would never know I was a A-list lawyer until...
 I did something stupid like "doing the right" in a global machiavellian world, which is most places on earth where the "rule of law", sadly is corruption. The biggest ongoing daily human rights violation. Some people don't know but must do it in order just to make enough to live, like the police in some countries because maybe they get paid a clothing allowance and a daily food allowance but not much more... while in others it could change if there was the will but it's been going on that way for so long that that's hard to switch from one day to the next.
I scuba diving,snowboarding, as well as hiking (2500+ hr underwater and 400 days over 4 years on a board). -- 🌱 I’m currently learning and working with developing fusion and multi-modal "deep machine learning" (I don't like these names as my basis is in philosophy and this is anthropomorphic. We don't know the fundamentals behind "consciousness", epistemology, or cosmology both macro and micro experiential and theoretical physics is a black box.
We know so much less than many people think we do about, basically, everything. I like the super sharp theoretical physicists who give you their ideology but always end with "but we don't know", as we cannot..... test, experiment, observe, fill in the blank,...
If they go on and on to end with BUT we don't know...bingo an honest scientist.
I am kind of new with GIT and coding but have been a "maker and tinker" for a long time. I had a TI-994a, then a C64 with 4 daisy-chained floppy drives, and my own BBS at 10 years old. -💻 I did take "a computer language" rather than a foreign language (relational databases) and ended up learning French and becoming a dual national. Einstien was the first "legal dual U.S. dual national" but now it is allowed. A word on Swiss French: "lente...ment"...and with more tonal shifts, as Swiss German 🇨🇭🇩🇪 is so much kinder and more beautiful 🎶🎼 to hear than "high German ⬆️🇩🇪- a little bit of language bias - guess to them. It's like hearing someone from Eastern, Kentucky,I assume,but much much more educated and sophisticated - I can say that as that is my birth place. But Swiss German🇨🇭🇧🇪🎹🎷🎻🎷 is so much nicer to listen to and the German spoken in Germany feels and sounds very 🛡️🗡️📣📢 to me. How did a "hillbilly" end up a A-list private international lawyer?!?❤️🤓💯💔☄️🎖️🎓🎓💼📚📚🇵🇪 (That's supposed to be the flag of Peru I couldn't find it but I ran into my future wife and now ex-wife with whom part of my heart is still madly in love with but life intervened ans she and all of us know she is half nuts - loved her totally anyway.) - we also have two children together who know nothing but 🇨🇭. they have been lied to and misdirected told mistrus or half truths and I've invited them to come and talk to me and one on one with no one else around I will tell them the absolute truth so they know because they have a right to know to hell with Swiss professional secrecy my children have a right to know what ruined their lives and what ended a fragile marriage but that marriage might have prevailed but given that the FIS and the federal government didn't intervene like they did when the massage were here and make no mistake the federal police positively identified the gru and the FSB acted on Swiss oil and they still are in Geneva uncontrolled and their level of human intelligence there is so poor that I know more and I've even offered to work for them and share with them what I've learned but their Eagles are so large that they can't even admit their mistake despite the American CIA having to send 20 agents to make sure that they didn't finish the job in 2017 and I know this because they told me and I can't ignore that I ever reveal who told me because they saved my life and it wasn't the first time the only country I relate with has failed me be it because I'm a immigrant Swiss or not a real Swiss in their minds but my father was a member of the Democratic National Committee in the United States so the United States really didn't want me to die second we're not been a very good things you're politically. but the fact that the United States government had to come here and do the job of something my government here should do and my wish to work for that agency because it's my wish that that never happens any other Swiss citizen ever again we should react the same that we did with the Israelis expel their diplomats freeze their assets and make them promise never to behave that way again here and the person who invited them should be in jail for treason. 
But I seemingly had unique skills that I didn't even know I had until I heard feedback long after my salary had increased significantly and I realized that I was good at doing the work. 🚫 It's exactly what they tell you not to do in law school Which is why learning new specialties of the law, expertly not just competently, as the type of clients here demand precision, no errors, or failure. The ability to find the best people to solve each problem and in the right place with the right knowledge, that usually involves multiple countries, and then merge everyone's work into legal functional solution. You're basically the conductor of a symphony🎼🎶of legal⚖️ experts from multiple countries or for our American🇺🇲 readers the quarterback🏉. You make sure you find the very best experts in any jurisdiction and make sure that they do it legally correctly and without error.

    • PLEASE DO NOT "LABEL AND DEFINE ME BY MY J.D.🧑‍⚖️ (Juris Doctor) - I founded the Honor Society in Philosophy🧑‍💻🧑‍🎓🏂⛷️🏊🚣 at my Uni and I was heavily pressured to become a lawyer ( despite taking it to the most difficult and "exclusive" level of ultra-wealthy private international business law. This specialty does not exist in the U.S., you get one course, ok one class, the ABA requirements on "conflicts of law". They tell you never to do in U.S. law school, yet every day I did and it was a perfect match for my ADHD and was like candy. But, we practice across the whole spectrum of specialty areas and normally in the 100mil + range (I just had to get used to a lot more zeros behind every transaction as the First Trust I ever wrote on my own was for over 1 billion dollars and I didn't sleep for a week thinking if I thought of every contingency possibility everything, crossed every t dotted every i). but I did everything from Criminal defense, to Aviation law, to having done the legal work for two full featured Hollywood films, three small brewery flips to a major beer manufacturer, natural resource extraction, real estate, resort management, securities law, sat on the board of directors of a financial newspaper, set on the board of directors of a hedge fund, was a registered financial intermediary with the Swiss Bankers Association, was the compliance officer for the law against money laundering, and never had a single bar complaint nor any civil or criminal suits for my professional behavior which as an American lawyer abroad requires significant effort and careful investigation of your clients. You must be very selective on who you will represent a person or not so guns, sex, and gambling were always never and tax evasion was clearly out and I would not represent a US person unless I was personally doing their income taxation as I won the book award in that class even though that only was about 10% of my workload. Honestly, I would have gone for an M.D, or a Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Science , Technology and Culture (which I may still do as long as as can be a associate prof. of law while doing it). It involves, more than one but up to handfuls ( I have worked in more countries than I have not) jurisdictions, for any given problem laid on your lap. Loydes and Swiss Re would not even attempt to underwrite our risk. They could not even determine the "risk". They has no idea what they were exposing themselves to and due to the air tight rules on Swiss professional secrecy, we couldn't tell them. banking secrecy may have taken a large hit here but the rules covering the attorney client relationship as well as just business secrets and intellectual property when you're working for a Swiss company and that applies and double doses to health data. It carries both criminal and civil penalty penalties so you can go to jail for breach. -We would ask or try every so often but it was always the same answer NO ⚡🏊🚣 Fun fact: I am a PADI Open Water Scuba Diver (was a Master Scuba Diver, Rescue Diver, then Dive Master and have done all their TecRec), IANTD, all their courses trimix, tech wreck, cave, etc..) and a GUE TECH 1 Diver. 
-🛟📷🎬⌨️💻💾⛵🛶🚀🌐🗺️🗾⚕️🥼 I teach First Response, was an EMT, had an Emergency Pharmaceuticals Course, ACLS, and did some DAN decompression chamber work and courses. I even teach coral reef conservation but "Peak Buoyancy and Don't Touch Anything in the Sea (not only does help not cause damage but we don't know what so many things are to this day you never know if it has tetrodotoxin or some other super nasty venom. They don't want to mess with you so it is much safer than you think. Just know where you are diving, know you limits, plan your dive and dive your plan. I hunted and fished my whole life.
I suck at pistols, but I could qualify, as I had two jobs with badges and guns. I was on my high school skeet team and like long-shot shooting the best. So, rifles like we used in Montana. You have to take long shots there. The valley are big, the wind unpredictable, and they will always know your near of you get too close. -Track a wounded animal that could be a very long time, few roads, and has to field dress it, quarter it, and carry it out in pieces. You get good through negative reinforcement. -When Diving- always come back with 1/3 of your gas (applies to Tech Divers, as we carry 4400l of gas min. (2x21l @ 220 bar of bottom gas mix) that's without a possible additional four 12l cylinders for deco - two under each arm (travel gas, or extra bottom gas, 50% /50% @ 25m and 100% O2@6m).
