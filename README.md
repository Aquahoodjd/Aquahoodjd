  - ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aquahoodjd
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning. I have an insatiable level of curiosity. I'm someone who was a "big deal" but didn't even know it until I got almost smashed into the ground 2m deep (6 feet deep). I'm really kind and nice. You would never know I was a A-list lawyer until...
- I did something stupid like "doing the right" in a global machiavellian world, which is mostly places on earth where the "rule of law", sadly is corruption. The bighest ongoing daily human rights violation. even though some people don't know on the tree have to do it in order just to make enough to live like the police in some countries because maybe they get paid a clothing allowance and a daily food allowance but not much more... while in others it could change if there was the will but it's been going on that way for so long that that's hard to switch from in the fast way. 
- I scuba diving,snowboarding, as well as hiking (2000+ hr underwater and 400 days over 4 years on a board). 
-- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and working with developing fusion and multimodal "deep machine learning" (I don't like these names as my basis is in philosophy and this is anthropomorphic. We don't know the fundamentals behind "consciousness, epistemology, or cosmology both macro and micro expermntil and theoretical paysics is a black box".
- We know so much less than many people think we do about, basically, everything. I like the super sharp theoretical physicists who give you their ideology but always end with "but we don't know", as we cannot..... test, experiment, observe, fill in the blank.

- There is an actor who ended up being quite sharp and he is right to ask a mathematician about how they deal with infinity in math or a cosmologist about "what exactly is gravity?
    
- If they go on and on to end with BUT we don't know...bingo an honest scientist.

- I am kindof new with GIT and coding but have been a "maker and tinker for a long time. I had a TI-994a and then a C64 with 4 daisy-chained floppy drives and had my own BBS at 10 years old.
-I did take *a computer language rather than a foreign language (relational databases) and ended up learning French and becoming a dual national. Einstien was the first "legal dual U.S. dual national" but now it is allowed. 
- Yeah, the Fone Phreking era" (black and blue boxes, 800 extenders" and  real "autodialer like in wargames  (which I had that Sinclar).
