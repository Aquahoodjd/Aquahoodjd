  - 👋 Hi, I’m @Aquahoodjd
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. I have an insatiable level of curiosity. I'm someone who was a "big deal" but didn't even know it until I got almost smashed into the ground 2m deep (6 feet deep). I'm really kind and nice. You would never know I was a A-list lawyer until...
- I did something stupid like "doing the right" in a global machiavellian world, which is mostly places on earth where the "rule of law", sadly is corruption. The bighest ongoing daily human rights violation. Some people don't know but must do it in order just to make enough to live, like the police in some countries because maybe they get paid a clothing allowance and a daily food allowance but not much more... while in others it could change if there was the will but it's been going on that way for so long that that's hard to switch from one day to the next. 
- I scuba diving,snowboarding, as well as hiking (2000+ hr underwater and 400 days over 4 years on a board). 
-- 🌱 I’m currently learning and working with developing fusion and multimodal "deep machine learning" (I don't like these names as my basis is in philosophy and this is anthropomorphic. We don't know the fundamentals behind "consciousness, epistemology, or cosmology both macro and micro expermntil and theoretical paysics is a black box".
- We know so much less than many people think we do about, basically, everything. I like the super sharp theoretical physicists who give you their ideology but always end with "but we don't know", as we cannot..... test, experiment, observe, fill in the blank.

- There is an actor who ended up being quite sharp and he is right to ask a mathematician about how they deal with infinity in math or a cosmologist about "what exactly is gravity?
    
- If they go on and on to end with BUT we don't know...bingo an honest scientist.

- I am kindof new with GIT and coding but have been a "maker and tinker for a long time. I had a TI-994a and then a C64 with 4 daisy-chained floppy drives and had my own BBS at 10 years old.
-💻 I did take *a computer language rather than a foreign language (relational databases) and ended up learning French and becoming a dual national. Einstien was the first "legal dual U.S. dual national" but now it is allowed.
A word on Swiss French: "lente...ment"...and with more tonal shifts, as Swiss German 🇨🇭🇩🇪 is so much kinder and more beautiful 🎶🎼 to hear than "high German ⬆️🇩🇪- a little bit of language bias - guess to them. It's like hearing someone from Eastern, Kentucky,I assume,but much much more educated and sophisticated - I can say that as that is my birth place. But Swiss German🇨🇭🇧🇪🎹🎷🎻🎷 is so much nicer to listen to and the German spoken in Germany feels and sounds very 🛡️🗡️📣📢  to me. How did a "hillbilly" end up a A-list private international lawyer?!?❤️🤓💯💔☄️✈️🎖️🎓🎓💼📚📚🇵🇪 (That's supposed to be the flag of Peru I couldn't find it but I ran into my future wife and now ex-wife with whom part of my heart is still madly in love with but life intervened) - we also have two children together who know nothing but 🇨🇭). But I seemingly had unique skills that I didn't even know I had until I heard feedback long after my salary had increased significantly and I realized that I was good at doing the work.
🚫 It's exactly what they tell you not to do in law school Which is learn new specialties of the law, expertly not just competently, as the type of clients here demand precision, no errors, or failure. The ability to  find the best people to solve each problem and in the right place with the right knowledge, that usually involves multiple countries, and then merge everyone's work into legal functional solution. You're basically the conductor of a symphony🎼🎶of legal⚖️ experts from multiple countries or for our American🇺🇲 readers the quarterback🏉. You make sure you find the very best experts in any jurisdiction and make sure that they do it legally correctly and without error.

-  PLEASE DO NOT "LABEL AND DEFINE ME BY MY J.D.🧑‍⚖️ (Juris Doctor) - I founded the Honor Society in Philosophy🧑‍💻🧑‍🎓🏂⛷️🏊🚣 at my Uni and I was heavily pressured to become a lawyer ( despite taking it to the most difficult and "exclusive" level of ultra-wealthy private international business law,
This speciality which does not exist in the U.S., you get one course, ok n the ABA requirements on "conflicts of law". They tell you never to do in U.S. law school, yet every day I did  and it was a perfect match for my ADHD and was like candy. But, we practice across the whole spectrum of specialty areas and normally in the 100mil + range (I just had to get used to a lot more zeros behind every transaction as the First Trust I ever wrote on my own was for over 1 billion dollars and I didn't sleep for a week thinking if I thought of every contingency possibility every, crossed every t dotted every i). but I did everything from Criminal defense, to Aviation law, to having done the legal work for two full featured Hollywood films, three small brewery flips to a major beer manufacturer, natural resource extraction, real estate, resort management, securities law, sat on the board of directors of a financial newspaper, set on the board of directors of a hedge fund, was a registered financial intermediary with the Swiss Bankers Association, was the compliance officer for the law against money laundering, and never had a single bar complaint nor any civil or criminal suits for my professional behavior which has an American lawyer abroad requires significant effort and careful investigation of your clients and very selective procedures on which you will represent a person or not so guns, sex, and gambling were always never and tax evasion was clearly out and I would not represent a US person unless I was personally doing their income taxation as I won the book award in that class even though that only was about 10% of my workload. 
It involves, more than one but up to handfuls ( I have worked on more countries than I have not) jurisdictions, for any given problem laid on your lap. Loydes and Swiss Re would not even attempt to underwrite our risk. They could not even determine the "risk". They has nonidea what they were exposing themselves to.and due ro th4 air tight rukes on Swiss professional secrecy, we couldn't tell them. banking secrecy may have taken a large hit here but the rules covering the attorney client relationship as well as just business secrets and intellectual property when you're working for a Swiss company and that applies and double doses to patience and health data. it carries both criminal and civil penalty penalties so you can go to jail for breach. 
-We would ask or try every so often but it was always the same answer NO
⚡🏊🚣 Fun fact: I am a PADI Open Water Scuba Diver (was a Master Scuba Diver, Rescue Diver, then Dive Master and have done all their TecRec), IANTD, all their courses trimix, tech wreck, cave, etc..) and a GUE TECH 1 Diver.
 
-🛟📷🎬⌨️💻💾⛵🛶🚀🌐🗺️🗾⚕️🥼 I teach First Response, was an EMT, had an Emergency Pharmaceuticals Course, ACLS, and did some DAN decompression chamber work and courses. I even teach coral reef conservation but "Peak Buoyancy and Don't Touch Anything in the Sea (not only does help not  cause damage but we don't know what so many things are to this day you never know if it has tetrodotoxin or some other super nasty venum. They don't want to mess with you so it is much safer than you think. Just know where you are diving, know you limits, plan your dive and dive your plan. I hunted and fished my whole life.
  - I suck at pistols, but I could qualify, as I had two jobs with badges and guns. I was on my high school skeet team and like long-shot shooting the best. SO, rifles like we used in Montana. You have to take long shots there. The valley are big, the wind unpredictable, and they will always know your near of you get too close. 
-Track a wounded animal that could be a very long time, few roads, and has to field dress it, quarter it, and carry it out in pieces. You get good through negative reenforcment. 
-When Diving-  always come back with 1/3 of your gas (applies to Tech Divers, as we carry 4400l of gas min.  (2x21l @ 220 bar of bottom gas mix) that's without a possible additional four 12l cylinders for deco - two under each arm (travel gas, or extra bottom gas, 50% /50% @ 25m and 100% O2@6m).
