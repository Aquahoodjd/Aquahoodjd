 👋 Hi, I’m @Aquahoodjd
 
 I'm editing this on a rebuilt Tower I thought i bricked but clearly didn't with Ubuntu Studio-. I will be 3 of 5 in a distributed system. This one is done for the moment.


I am kind of new with GIT and coding but have been a "maker and tinker" for a long time. I had a TI-994a, then a C64 with 4 daisy-chained floppy drives, and my own BBS at 10 years old. -💻 I did take "a computer language" rather than a foreign language (relational databases) and ended up learning French and becoming a dual national. Einstien was the first "legal dual U.S. dual national" but now it is allowed. A word on Swiss French: "lente...ment"...and with more tonal shifts, as Swiss German 🇨🇭🇩🇪 is so much kinder and more beautiful 🎶🎼 to hear than "high German ⬆️🇩🇪- a little bit of language bias - guess to them. It's like hearing someone from Eastern, Kentucky,I assume,but much much more educated and sophisticated - I can say that as that is my birth place. But, Swiss German🇨🇭🇧🇪🎹🎷🎻🎷 is so much nicer to listen to and the German spoken in Germany feels and sounds very 🛡️🗡️📣📢 to me. How did a "hillbilly" end up a A-list private international lawyer?!?❤️🤓💯💔☄️🎖️🎓🎓💼📚📚🇵🇪 (That's supposed to be the flag of Peru I couldn't find it but I ran into my future wife and now ex-wife with whom part of my heart is still madly in love with but life intervened ans she and all of us know she is half nuts - loved her totally anyway.) - we also have two children together who know nothing but 🇨🇭. 


Bu, I seemingly have unique skills that I didn't even know I had until I heard feedback  later. I realized that I was very good at doing "private international law" 🚫 It's exactly what they tell you not to do in law school. Practice across all specialties in the law in all the jurisdictions in the world (or with the assistance of local counsel (always) but the synthesis from multiple jurisdictions was my job and it can get tricky quickly finding a legal solution to every single problem that was thrown my direction. One where the primary tested me saying 10 different specialist in said field said, "can't be done" and I hated the word "can't" and inside of 36 hours I had it done legally. Here you must be flexible learn new specialties of the law, expertly not just competently, as the type of clients here demand precision, no errors, or failure. The ability to find the best people to solve each problem and in the right place with the right knowledge, that usually involves multiple countries, and then merge everyone's work into legal functional solution. You're basically the conductor of a symphony🎼🎶of legal⚖️ experts from multiple countries or for our American🇺🇲 readers the quarterback🏉. You make sure you find the very best experts in any jurisdiction and make sure that they do it legally, correctly, and without error.

-PLEASE DO NOT "LABEL AND DEFINE ME BY MY J.D.🧑‍⚖️ (Juris Doctor)" or my birth country- I founded the Honor Society in Philosophy🧑‍💻🧑‍🎓🏂⛷️🏊🚣 at my Uni and I was heavily pressured to become a lawyer ( despite taking it to the most difficult and "exclusive" level of ultra-wealthy private international business law. This specialty does not exist in the U.S., you get one course, ok one class, the ABA requirement on "conflicts of law". They tell you never to do in U.S. law school, yet every day I did and it was a perfect match for my ADHD and was like candy. But, we practice across the whole spectrum of specialty areas and normally in the 100mil + range (I just had to get used to a lot more zeros behind every transaction as the first trust I ever wrote on my own was for over 1 billion dollars.  I didn't sleep for a week thinking if I thought of every contingency, every possibility,crossed every t dotted every i. I have done everything from criminal defense, to aviation law, to having done the legal work for two full featured Hollywood films, three small brewery flips to a major beer manufacturer, natural resource extraction, real estate, resort management, securities law, sat on the board of directors of a financial newspaper, set on the board of directors of a hedge fund, was a registered financial intermediary with the Swiss Bankers Association, was the compliance officer for the law against money laundering, and never had a single bar complaint nor any civil or criminal suits for my professional behavior, which as an American lawyer abroad requires significant effort and careful investigation of your clients. You must be very selective on who you will represen. So NO guns, sex, and gambling were always never and tax evasion was clearly out and I would not represent a US person unless I was personally doing their income taxation.  I won the book award in that class even though that only was about 10% of my workload. Honestly, I would have gone for an M.D, or a Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Science,Technology, and Culture (which I may still do as long as as can be a associate prof. of law while doing it). I have worked in more countries than I have not jurisdictions, for any given problem laid on your lap. Loydes and Swiss Re would not even attempt to underwrite our risk. They could not even determine the "risk". They has no idea what they were exposing themselves to and due to the air tight rules on Swiss professional secrecy, we couldn't tell them. Banking secrecy may have taken a large hit here but the rules covering the attorney client relationship as well as just business secrets and intellectual property when you're working for a Swiss company and that applies and double doses to health data. It carries both criminal and civil penalty penalties so you can go to jail for breach. -We would ask or try every so often but it was always the same answer NO ⚡🏊🚣  But, the institutional knowledge of your average portfolio manager is likely one of the best you could have anywhere. The competition and the unique way they are educated i.e. the Director of UBS NY Private Bank was trained and educated in-house and had Federal Equivalency Diplomas recognized by Switzerland and the EU with the same force as University Education. He had their full historical and contemporary institutional knowledge of world economics and markets and rose through the ranks from within and the same goes for most og them only if it was an exception lateral hire of an exemplary manager would they be from outside. Those are few and far in-between ad there are more banques than most people have ever heard of as at one small bank they poached BNP Paribas's chief economist. Said banque has a few hundred account holders as that's all they need. You get the very best investment advisors and account managers from either internal advancement from 18 up or the occasional extremal exception lateral hire like the chief economist of one of the world'd largest banques for a couple of hundred clients. He must have something other people don't. I know he does as I used to have lunch with him once a month. The Director of UBS NY Private Bank - a brilliant man. He came from within starting as an intern. I know world business like few do from having done it. I'm not talking out of a book but in the words of my first boss here, "you did everyday what most law students wish they could do but will never be able to do!" He was not lying or exaggerating. He is speaking to me from his death bed. I will miss him dearly and it's been a slow terrible death (MS). 

Fun fact: I am a PADI Open Water Scuba Diver (was a Master Scuba Diver, Rescue Diver, then Dive Master and have done all their TecRec), IANTD, all their courses trimix, tech wreck, cave, etc..) and a GUE TECH 1 Diver. 
    
-🛟📷🎬⌨️💻💾⛵🛶🚀🌐🗺️🗾⚕️🥼 I teach First Response, was an EMT, had an Emergency Pharmaceuticals Course,and did some DAN decompression chamber work and courses. I teach Coral Reef Conservation but "Peak Buoyancy" and Don't Touch Anything in the Sea (not only does it cause damage but we don't know what so many things are to this day you never know if it has tetrodotoxin or some othervenom).  They don't want to mess with you so just watch don't chase or harrass them you could end up losing a limb or worse. Just know where you are diving, know you limits, plan your dive and dive your plan. I hunted and fished my whole life. Eat the Rich they are vegan! 

-When Diving- always come back with 1/3 of your gas (applies to Tech Divers, as we carry 4400l of gas min. (2x21l @ 220 bar of bottom gas mix) that's without a possible additional four 12l cylinders for deco or travel gas- two under each arm (travel gas, or extra bottom gas, 50% /50% @ 25m and 100% O2@6m).
